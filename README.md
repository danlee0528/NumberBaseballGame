# NumberBaseballGame
It's kind of a guessing game, but it has a twist ! Do you want to try it out ?

#<Background>
Back in high school, I used to play a number guessing game on a piece of paper with friends. This game I played with freidns was a bit different from how people intuitively know about number guessing games. No one knew where the game was originated from, but it was phenomenal in my childhood.


#<Rules>
With a little twist of baseball game rules, players get to guess the number of computer which is of 4 digits (repetitive). A total number of 10 guesses is allowed and each time players take a guess, a condition is given as follows:

>> _ S _ B _ O 

S represents the number of strikes 
B represents the number of balls
O represents the number of outs


1 Strike means players guessed a correct dgit at correct location
1 Ball means players guessed a correct digit at incorrect location
1 Out means players guessed an incorrect digit at incorrect location

*The more Outs you have, the clearer computer's number be

To help you understand better , here's an example
Supposed computer chose a number, 1234, and player takes his/her first guess as 5431. The condition to be given is [ 1S 2B 1O ]. Because 134 are in the computer's number and the location of 3 matches with the user's guess. 1 Out results from 5 not being in the computer's number.
